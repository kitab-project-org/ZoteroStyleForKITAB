# Zotero problems to be resolved




### 1. volume -> vol. not vols.

The way of entering the data put an ‘s’ onto vols. Because we have other information tacked onto end. This seems to be because we use page page numbers after volume # without specifying i.e. writing p. before the page number. 

Yāqūt, _Muʿjam al-udabāʾ,_ vol. 4, 1698, entry 743, ms. 1199.

 - vols but should say vol. (with a period?)
 
ʻAlī ibn al-Ḥasan Ibn ʻAsākir, Taʾrīkh madīnat Dimashq: wa-dhikr faḍlihā wa-tasmiyat man ḥallahā min al-amāthil aw ijtāza bi-nawāḥīhā min wāridīhā wa-ahlihā, ed. Muḥibb al-Dīn Abī Saʻīd ʻUmar b. Gharāmah al-ʻ Amrawī (Beirut: Dār al-Fikr, 1995), vols 2, 412, 0571IbnCasakir.TarikhDimashq.JK000916., ms. 00652.

### 3. "al-" capitalization
Whether article "al-" should be capitalized or not within a note when starting a name. In the case below, the style editor capitalises Al, where it shouldn't

e.g. See especially al-Dhahabī, _Siyar aʿlām al-nubalāʾ,_ ed. Shuʿayb Arnāʾūṭ and Ḥusayn Asad, 25 vols (Beirut: Muʾassasat al-Risāla, 1985), vol. 20, 554–6, 0748Dhahabi.SiyarAclamNubala.Shamela0010906, ms. 6647–8.
- two interim solutions: 1. use the full name of the author, such as Abu Ḥāmid al-Ghazālī, Muḥammad al-Dhahabī; 2. Add the preceding text, as 'prefix' (in the example above, add "See especially, as 'prefix' in Zotero.)


 



# General questions

### 1. Citing blogs
Do we treat each blog as a distinct article – giving new full citation of a source? Or can we assume readers of blog 2 read blog 1 and not repeat? Can we find a workaround – listing in the left margin a link to the blog series bibliography?

### Series
##### rom Sarah: Should we have series in our style or not? I am inclined to include – but it’s up to the team. 
In note, here and throughout: I generally recommend omitting series names from citations, since that information is rarely needed and few authors manage to include it consistently, but it cer-tainly doesn’t hurt.

### Do we need the [Accessed 21-04-2023] note for stable releases such as for the OpenITI?


# Resolved. (When we fix a problem, we move it here for the record.)

###	Handling of multiple editors. (now fixed: Aslisho changed "and others" with "et. al")

The Zotero style says Lorenz Nigst ‘and others’ rather than ‘et al’, as it should 

e.g. Lorenz Nigst et al., ‘OpenITI: A Machine-Readable Corpus of Islamicate Texts’ (Zenodo, 2022), https://zenodo.org/record/6808108 [accessed 27 February 2023].

`this was recolved, we will have up to 6 authors listed in Bibliography and 'et. al' in notes`

### URL – remove <>, add ‘,’ before the URL? Hanna wrote into my notes: (also changed now)
In note: I have  deleted the angle brackets from URLs and the like in line with the style guide, but if Zotero insists on them, you will probably find it easiest to keep them

###  Extra period now removed from URIs, ms0000 should be added as a page number with a preceding comma (,). When milestone not present, the URI automatically ends with a fullstop.

###  Ed. and eds. (this has also been resolved)
#### The editors of volumes now come before edited volumes; (eds) comes after the editors name between ()

I have also changed 'edited by' to 'ed.' 

As in Sarah Bowen Savant, ‘People Versus Books’, in Bruce Fudge et al. (eds), Non Sola Scriptura (London: Routledge, 2022), 286, DOI: 10.4324/9781003252221-18.

And NOT: Sarah Bowen Savant, ‘People Versus Books’, in  _Non Sola Scriptura_, ed. Bruce Fudge et al.(London: Routledge, 2022), 286, DOI: 10.4324/9781003252221-18.

An earlier version of the style didn't make distinction between the editors of classical texts _(Tarikh Madinat Dimashq)_ and edited volumes _(Non Sola Scriptura)_. This has been fixed now.
