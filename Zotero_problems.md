# Zotero problems to be resolved
1.	Handling of multiple editors. The Zotero style says Lorenz Nigst ‘and others’ rather than ‘et al’, as it should 

e.g. Lorenz Nigst et al., ‘OpenITI: A Machine-Readable Corpus of Islamicate Texts’ (Zenodo, 2022), https://zenodo.org/record/6808108 [accessed 27 February 2023].
This graph also appears in Sarah Bowen Savant, ‘People Versus Books’, in Bruce Fudge et al. (eds), _Non Sola Scriptura_ (London: Routledge, 2022), 286, DOI: 10.4324/9781003252221-18.

2. I have changed 'edited by' to 'ed.' but we need to ensure the name of the editor  comes before the title of the edited volume. 

As in Sarah Bowen Savant, ‘People Versus Books’, in Bruce Fudge et al. (eds), Non Sola Scriptura (London: Routledge, 2022), 286, DOI: 10.4324/9781003252221-18.

And NOT: Sarah Bowen Savant, ‘People Versus Books’, in  _Non Sola Scriptura_, ed. Bruce Fudge et al.(London: Routledge, 2022), 286, DOI: 10.4324/9781003252221-18.

3. The way of entering the data put an ‘s’ onto vols. Because we have other information tacked onto end

Yāqūt, _Muʿjam al-udabāʾ,_ vol. 4, 1698, entry 743, ms. 1199.

4. Whether article "al-" should be capitalized or not within a note when starting a name:

e.g. See especially al-Dhahabī, _Siyar aʿlām al-nubalāʾ,_ ed. Shuʿayb Arnāʾūṭ and Ḥusayn Asad, 25 vols (Beirut: Muʾassasat al-Risāla, 1985), vol. 20, 554–6, 0748Dhahabi.SiyarAclamNubala.Shamela0010906, ms. 6647–8.


# General questions
1.	Do we treat each blog as a distinct article – giving new full citation of a source? Or can we assume readers of blog 2 read blog 1 and not repeat? Can we find a workaround – listing in the left margin a link to the blog series bibliography?
