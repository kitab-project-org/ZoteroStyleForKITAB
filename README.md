I believe this style guide will mostly do for now, but we will have to make some changes as we go along, especially with regard to citing the OpenITI files, datasets, and primary Arabic sources. Please let me know if you have any questions. For the most part, we hope  that the style guide will make it easier for us to remain on the same page.
