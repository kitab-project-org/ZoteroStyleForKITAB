# ZoteroStyleForKITAB
Zotero Citation Style for the ERC volume


Please download and install the following citation style on Zotero. This is a slightly modified version of the Oxford Style, as suggested by Hanna (While the Oxford Style suppresses ‘publisher’s name’ in references, I have modified it to keep it.

I believe this style guide will mostly do for now, but we will have to make some changes as we go along, especially with regard to citing the OpenITI files, datasets, and primary Arabic sources. Please let me know if you have any questions.
